jBot
====
An open source API that enables developers to create and manage their own local Runescape bots. It's designed to be easy-to-use and to allow the player to have as much control over the functionality of the bots as possible. All of the code is extensively documented so the user can fully understand what's going on behind the scenes.

jBot currently runs on Java 8, so users will need to be developing using Java 8 in order to use this API.
